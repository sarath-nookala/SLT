Finally, an older man came in; he was a plastic surgeon. .
I felt funny because a plastic surgeon was going to give me the stitches. .
I thought some regular doctor, nurse, or even doctor's assistant could do it. .
But all the same, he told me I better go downstairs and get an x-ray. .
He wanted to check if I had some air in my finger which could cause an infection. .
My x-ray result showed that my finger was cut to the joint. .
He said I was very lucky that my finger was not cut more or I would have lost it.  I was relieved! .
I went back upstairs to give the plastic surgeon my X-Ray results. .
Finally, he said we were ready.  He set everything up. .
He got the scissors, the needle, and the string.  I saw the needle and the thick string and thought "whoa!" .
He gave my hand a few injections. .
My hand became numb, and he stitched it. .
I could feel the stitches being pulled through--it felt like when you tie your shoes... .
...that's kind of how the stitching felt. .
After he finished, he wrapped up my finger. .
He gave me instructions; he told me, "you cannot get it wet." .
Then, when you shower, you will need to use a plastic bag to cover your hand. .
After he explained everything that I needed to do, I said "fine, alright then". .
I finally arrived home around 7:30.  I was beat. .
Really, I had to take shower because I had been working all day, plus I had blood all over me. .
So anyway, I went in the shower--I had put two bags on my hand to be safe. .
I wrapped my hand and the bag with a rubber band and walked into the shower. .
While the water was running, I tried to wash myself as best I could--I couldn't use my injured hand. .
I picked up the shampoo bottle and dumped it on my hand.  Right after I poured it, it hit me that I couldn't use that hand. .
I wasn't thinking.   Now shampoo was oozing all over my hand.  Geez. .
I went and got another bag to put on my hand. .
Then I got back into the shower and washed up. It felt so good! .
Then, I went to bed for the night to get ready to work all day today. .

I remember a while ago, I was driving... .
I was driving across the U.S. .
(I was) on Interstate 80, the one that goes straight across the country. .
I was driving for a long time. .
The road was very dry and plain. .
As I was driving, I was really bored. So I started thinking about what I could do. .
As I was driving I thought "why don't I turn off the road." .
I was driving through the country. .
I drove along the curvy two-lane highway. .
I thought "why don't I just drive on". .
I looked and saw an exit ahead. .
I turned off the road at the exit. .
I drove the car along the road. .
I was driving through beautiful hills. .
Occasionally, I would pass a house or two. .
It started to get dark, so I turned on the headlights. .
With the headlights on, I kept driving. .
I was enjoying the drive. .
It happened that, far down the road... .
...over a hill... .
...there was a deer. .
The deer was eating grass. .
The deer stopped eating grass and looked up. .
The deer saw, across the road... .
...a big pile of grass that looked delicious! .
Seeing that, the deer decided to walk across the road. .
I drove up the hill with my headlights on. .
I noticed some animal crossing the road. .
As I drove, the deer turned and looked at me. .
I saw the deer but it was too late. .
The headlights got closer and closer to the deer. .
The deer was frozen in shock. .
I swerved and slammed on the brakes; the headlights shone right in the deer's face. .
I swerved hard, right before I was about to hit the deer. .
The car swerved off the road. .
The deer was in shock and scared. .
I was trying to gain control of the car as it swerved. .
The car spun. .
As I held the wheel, I thought to myself "wow". Then I looked back at the road. .
The deer looked at me and then moved on to cross the road. .
My heart was pounding. .
My heart was beating really fast. .
I caught my breath.  It had been a close call. .
My car was in the middle of the road, angled perpendicular to the road.  I didn't know which direction I had been going! .
I wasn't sure which way to go. .
I decided to head down one of the ways. .
I drove really slowly. .
I saw a sign up ahead. .
It was for route 80.  I saw it. .
I went ahead and got back on 80. .
I pulled the car onto route 80. .
The flat road was boring but at least it was safe! .

Really, football... .
...is my favorite sport. .
It is really inspiring.  It involves many things: .
It's eleven on eleven; players on the two teams match up in the competition. .
One team has the offensive line... .
The offense picks a bunch of guys who weigh 300, 350 pounds to block... .
...the quarterback, who has the running back behind him. .
There are many different options: they can pass to the wide receiver, .
or they can hand off to the running back, .
they can throw to the Tight End, maybe, or, I don't know... .
...they can get creative, mix it up.  Really, after a thousand plays, you can be creative during the game. .
Really, I find that to be a very amazing challenge. .
Especially when football is the only legal sport where you can hit someone that hard and not get fined for it. .
...I mean, unless you use your helmet to hit someone, but... .
Really, I've been thinking it reminds me of who really made me get interested in football. .
My mother bought me a book written by Vince Lombardi. .
Really, up until then, as I was growing up, I... .
...I didn't know much about football untill my mom gave me that book. .
I remember I was young.  It was my first book I read... .
I really was engrossed by football.  He, ... .
...Vince Lombardi, was REALLY a winner. .
He made sure his players would "give it all. " .
They didn't care about money: back in the 50s and 60s, football... .
...really, football players now make millions of dollars. .
Before, they used to play for food, or for, I don't even know... .
It was the same as any regular life--later they would work at the Post Office, or, I don't know... .
...so that, Vince Lombardi--I remember his special speech... .
...before facing the Oakland Raiders in the first Super Bowl. .
He came in and told his men: .
"I don't want to see any End Zone... .
"...celebrations when you score a touchdown. .
"I want to see, once you're in that end zone, .
"I want to see you put the ball down on the ground... .
"I don't want to see you dance, .
"I don't want to see you scream .
"I don't want you to run to the fans and cheer. .
"I want you to come back and sit down where you belong. .
"...and wait until it's your turn to play again." .
What motivating words Vince Lombardi used! .
Reading the book, that kind of... .
I never realized that football could have that much emotion involved. .
I just thought it was eleven guys hitting another eleven guys. .
So I decided to play high school football. .
Personally, I think I'm a better coach than a player... .
...but at the same time I love to play. .
I enjoy the hits--I enjoy the pain sometimes, I admit, but, uh... .
...not all the time.  Like my hand, haha--no, not like that. .
Really, Vince Lombardi told his men... .
...this is really my favorite quote.  Before that Super Bowl game, .
He said, "Men, we must march into that end zone... .
"...and then come back and wait until it's your turn," just like I said before .
"Then hit, and hit, and hit!" .
I know, it seems like three simple words, "hit and hit and hit," .
but when a hit is made in football, .
...it can create many things. .
It can create an opportunity for the other team to win, .
...it can create a fumble, .
It could be, I don't know, a quarterback sack, .
...or, I don't know, really many other things.  It's the same idea as in chess: it's a thinking game .
Vince Lombardi, before his men walked onto the field, .
...he told his men, "Hey, remember: winning isn't everything-- .
it's the only thing. .

Really, last weekend, I got together with twenty friends .
We, Deafies, went to Maine for white water rafting. .
I arrived on Friday night. .
There were tents set up all over. .
There was a lot of beer everwhere, and people mingling. .
We stayed up very late. The next morning we woke up. .
We had to be patient because we got up at seven o'clock in the morning. .
We were ready for our great adventure! .
We went in the bus after breakfast. .
We got in the bus, took off, and arrived to one river. .
...I don't know, it started with a K.  It's a long word, that river. .
It was close by, twenty minutes away from our camp ground. .
We sat on the raft. .
I have to admit that it was my first time. .
I didn't know what to do--I thought it would feel like being on a boat on the water.  I thought it wasn't a big deal. .
We started to sit down. .
We had a leader that sat at the back of the raft. .
There were eight of us in the raft,  and both people in front had to be hearing. .
So I can follow how to row. .
They will know when it is the right time to stop rowing or drag the paddle. .
The leader would yell but we Deaf people cannot hear him in the back. .
So we sat down and got ready. .
The boat was really slow.  I thought, no problem. .
I was rowing and thought it was boring. .
I tapped my friend Tony. .
I tapped him and said, "THAT's white water rafting?" .
The boat suddenly shot down; the rapids were churning all around us. .
I flew out of the raft--I was dumbfounded. .
I was lost--I couldn't find the boat.  The boat came around... .
...I waved at the raft, and they came and got me... .
...and another guy, Mike Daisy, who also fell off. .
They pulled me back onto the raft. .
We got back into our seats.  I was a bit shaken.. .
I realized it was serious business. .
I dug my foot into the side of the raft so I wouldn't fall again. .
There was waving while we were rowing, and people fell off the raft. .
It was fun all day and we had a good time.  We decided to take a break. .
We pulled over for a lunch break. .
We had a choice of steak or chicken. .
I went for the steak--I love steak.  We ate quickly, .
...and when that was done we got on the raft again .
The raft headed down the river.  The man in the back, our leader,... .
He warned us that later, further down, would be be tougher. .
He expected a bunch of us to fall out. .
I looked at him and said OK, that is fine. .
The raft went down some rapids--really, it was fifteen feet straight down .
I braced myself as we went down--I was expecting to fall out. .
We went down and many people fell off. .
The only left was me and Mike Daisy. It's ironic that us two stayed on.  It is strange. .
It is ironic because we both fell before, .
...but he and I were the ones to "survive" that drop. .
I pulled people back onto the raft. .
One woman who was riding with us... .
...was stuck under the boat and could not breathe for a while. .
I reached under the raft and found her. .
I held my paddle out to her. .
I pulled her close with the paddle and then pulled her back on. .
She was coughing and I thought maybe we would have to do CPR on her. .
But she spit up the water. .
She threw up a little, it was really nothing big, it was as if she had a cold or something. .
Really, everything was fine; the girl was worried . .
I arrived... .
...and called it a day.  We pulled over. .
We got back on the bus and arrived at the campground. .
Most of us got in the spa. .
We just sat and relaxed--Aaahhh... .

After I explained Wyoming, the tons of cows and all that... .
Really, all the way through Nebraska... .
I was disappointed--you know this, my pager?  It didn't work all the way through Nebraska. .
I couldn't chat as I was driving. .
"Really, I was driving alone.  My two friends were driving in front of me.  So I drove..." .
...It's really far to Omaha--it's the end of Nebraska .
"Really, it's about 500 miles across Nebraska." .
I didn't realize that Nebraska was really that big! But anyway, so I was driving... .
All of sudden, a strong storm hit.  I was a bit nervous driving through it. .
My friends in front of me wanted to pull over. .
I told them its important to go slowly, 45 or 50 MPH. .
"Be patient, we'll drive together, and the rain will dissipate." I said. .
It is important to escape the big storm. .
My friend said "nah, its better to pull over." "Okay, fine," I said, "I'd be happy to." I said sarcastically.  We pulled over. .
We went into a restaurant.  I was hungry because I hadn't eaten lunch yet. .
I went in; the place was really creepy. .
There were no waiters... .
The tables and chairs were all wood.  It looked like a log cabin. .
We were uneasy,  but we said "OK, fine," and the three of us sat down around a table. .
I opened the menu; the choices were limited, but we let it slide. .
We decided to have hamburger and French fries, something simple. .
The waitress came over.  I told her that I'm Deaf. .
The waitress came up and talked into my ear. .
I gestured, "No, I'm Deaf!"  So she came around and started talking right in my face.  I said, "No, no--move back." .
I wrote to explain that Deaf people can read lips. .
Really, some can read lips and some communicate with paper and pen. .
The waitress said, "Oh.  Which do you prefer?"  I said I wanted paper and pen, haha. .
Because that waitress was really hard to understand. .
...anyway, I wrote that I wanted a burger with fries, just simple...cooked medium.. .
My friends did the same.  They both wrote down their orders, we gave the waitress the paper, and off she went. .
We waited and waited.  The rain stopped; I said, "Oh, good." .
I was in a hurry for the food to arrive--I wanted to take advantage of the good weather for driving, but it didn't work out that way.  We waited and waited and waited. .
The food finally came.  I looked again--it had plain Wonder bread for a bun and a tiny little burger. .
Really, I would have preferred a McDonald's burger--they're better than this one was.  Oh well. .
I took a bite... it was gross.  We all decided, "Forget it." .
The food was not good, so we just left it. .
I told the waitress that I was unsatified with the food and that we'd pay for the drinks. .
The waitress said, "Are you sure? Do you want anything else?"  I said, "Nah, I've decided to take off." .
We left.  As we were driving, we were really hungry. .
