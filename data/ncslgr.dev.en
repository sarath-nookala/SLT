They hit me twice with the nightstick and punched me in the eye. .
I was in shock. .
Why did they hit me? I didnt feel anything! .
I felt numb. .
Because I was so shocked that I, I don't know. .
What did the cop hit me for? .
Then they grabbed my hands and handcuffed me.  I was under arrest. .
I tried to tell the cop that I'm Deaf.  I spoke, "Deaf, Deaf!" .
They ignored me. .
They grabbed me and led me off.  I didn't know what to do. .
I had no clue of what was going on. .
Why would the  cop arrest me? .
I really thought it was maybe because I went to the bathroom in the public. .
Really, I ended up getting arrested for that? .
I thought--I didn't know, it could have been. .
I expected they would put me in the cruiser. .
While they brought me to the cruiser, one girl who was ready to go home... .
...saw the whole thing. .
She went back up to the party and informed some of my friends... .
...that I had been arrested by the police. .
Some of my friends said, "Really?" .
My friend came downstairs and went outside. .
He saw me in the cop car. .
He said, "Hey, hey, I know him!  I know Mike, the one in the car." .
The cop looked at my friend and pulled me out of the car. .
I was really lucky my friend came in time. .
The cop pulled me out of the car... .
Then my friend asked what was going on. .
The cop looked at my friend and said, "he took drugs." .
My friend looked over incredulously. .
He knew that I never take drugs. .
The cop said, "No... .
"...I saw him put something in his mouth" .
I couldn't believe it!  I said to myself, "Oh my god!" .
How could they guess that? .
Then it struck me: I had pulled the cigarette from my pocket and put it to my mouth. .
They thought I was popping a pill, I don't know. .
But I tried to tell my friend that I was just smoking a cigarette. .
My friend said "Oh," and informed the cop that I was smoking a cigarette. .
Maybe you misunderstood and thought he was taking something. .
The cop said, "No, I saw it very clearly." .
"I will take him to the hospital now." .
He said, "to pump out his stomach." .
My friend looked at him and said "Oh, no, no..." .
"You will be wasting your time!"  They were talking back and forth. .
He said, "no, no."  The cop was just looked at him and shook his head 'no'. .
He was looking and then finally, he was willing... .
He took off the handcuffs. .
He pushed me and I fell to the ground. .
I fell--what was that?! Then I got up. .
Of course, I was very upset. .
I was confused, really I felt many different things at once. .
Really, I felt... .
...like one side of me felt like hitting the cop. .
But, of course I couldn't do that. .
So, fine.  The cop said... .
The cop told my friend, "make sure you keep an eye on him overnight." .
"You never know if he'll have to go to the hospital tonight." .
I was ticked, but I decided to ingore him. .
He said, "make sure not to pee in public again!" Then he left. .
I was really upset. .
I had a big bruise near my eye.  Why... .
...did he hit me?  I had a bad headache next morning .
But anyway, my friend said "calm down, it's alright." .
I felt fine and just forgot about it. .
But, from now on, LAPD should really teach their officers... .
... to make sure they will approach Deaf people in right way. .
If something happens and they show up, they should make sure they have paper and pen ready. .
Or, if they really need to arrest someone, cuff him with his hands in front of his body... .
So he can communicate, either writing or by signing. .
But the hands behind the back, never again! .
That's something that I hope the LAPD will learn .
You probably wondering why I didn't report it to the police. .
Because I felt it would be their word against mine. .
Take Rodney King, for example. .
They have it on tape, beating him up. .
But, they still took LAPD's word against Rodney King's. .
Really, I admit, I didn't want to bring up... .
...that I went to the bathroom in public--I didn't want that on the record. .
I would look bad, and plus... .
I was drinking underage, too. .
John watches TV everyday. .
John is eating. .
Who told Bill yesterday?  Mary (did). .
I must inform you it won't be easy. .
As for Mary and vegetables, I know she likes corn. .
Did someone find a book? .
Has John finished reading the book? .
Is that John's father's car? .
What did John buy?  Books. .
John decided to visit Mary. .
Will father like that book? .
Why did mother buy a car? .
I enjoy working for Carol. .
I am going to compare two different cities, Boston and Los Angeles. .
I was born and raised in Boston. .
I went to LA after finishing high school.  I went to college at CSUN, Calfornia State University at Northridge. I went in '96. .
There are many things to compare.  For example, Boston's food is delicious and better (than LA). .
First of all, I think nothing compares with Boston seafood. Second, the meat here is fresh and more flavorful.  California meat... .
... is not great.  However, maybe they have better dairy products. I don't know. .
Third, the fruits and vegetables in California taste fresher, since they grow in California. .
The farm system in California is more outside because it is too hot to have it inside. .
Outside it's still hot and dry, but it's still easier to grow crops in the L.A. area. .
So, let's see, what else is on the list...I have to admit that Mexican food in LA is better. .
Of course, it's because L.A. is near the Mexican border. .
There isn't any Mexican food in the Boston area.  It's not bad, but I don't really care for Mexican food anyway. If you like Mexican food though you should take advantage of it in L.A. where it's delicious. .
There are very strict policies on fruit, and vegetables in California. .
The same policy goes for sheep. On Interstate 5 at one of the stops.... .
They will stop and make sure no one brings in any fruits or vegetables from Mexico. .
...or anywhere else. The state is very strict about chemicals. They want to make sure everything runs smoothly. .
I have never heard of that kind of situation here in Boston. .
Well, that is what I learned in L.A. .
Other than food, I can compare the two environments. .
Of course, Boston has four different seasons. .
While in LA, they only have one or two seasons. .
In LA, the weather tends to be "flat"--75 or 80 degrees, sunny and dry, every day. .
But here in Boston, the weather is really unpredictable.  It could be rainy, hot, cold or cool. .
There are many various things (in Boston weather), but one thing I notice about LA... .
...and here in Boston is that the fall, in September, seems about the same. .
I would notice once when the leaves change color, and some start to fall off and grass is really green. .
It is perfect, but during the fall in LA, it still looks like summer.  It is still very hot. .
The grass is a little bit brownish because of too much sun, and there is not enough rain to feed the flowers and plants. .
In December in Boston, of course it snows, gets colder and the leaves fall off the trees, leaving them "naked." .
In LA, it gets a little bit cooler,  but at same time it is still hot. .
To most Bostonians who are in LA it still feels hot, 70 to 75 degrees. .
The sun still shines warmly, but during night time, it gets a little cooler. .
I have to admit that during spring time in Boston, it rains a lot. .
While in LA, its better and perfect because of no rain. .
Well, it rains once a while.  The funny thing about when it rains in LA... .
People go too far:  they use umbrellas, wear rain coats, and put boots and pants on. .
Even if it is just barely raining--like a few drops.  I remember one day... .
I would go to class on my rollerblades, in shorts and a tank top, you know, like a basketball jersey. .
There was a bit of rain as I rollerbladed. .
I noticed many people were looking at me like I was a complete idiot.  Really, I didn't know what the big deal was. .
I thought the weather was nice, a little rainy but it was nothing.  People were wearing long sleeves! .
Oh well.  Wow--one negative thing about LA is that in LA, they didn't have any sewer systems. .
There would be flooding.  If a whole year's worth of Boston's rain were given to LA,... .
... LA would flood for sure. .
Why? Because they have a better sewer system in Boston to drain water. .
Here (in Boston) it could rain every day and people would still live through it without a problem. .
But of course, it doesn't rain everyday in Boston.  We have wonderful weather here. .
Another thing: in the summer, it's very humid here. .
The sun is more intense here, while in LA it's dry, but it's 100 to 110 degrees. .
In Northridge, it tends to be ten to fifteen degrees hotter than LA. .
If you see on weather channel, you will notice that if its 85 degrees in LA, that means 100 degrees in Northridge. .
Really, it's a big difference from here. .
If it's 80 degrees here in Boston, it can feel really hot.  But in LA, 80 degrees feels like nothing. .
In LA, the sun is farther away.  Here, the sun feels closer, more intense, because the seasons change.  That's all for that... .
...other than weather, we can also talk about Boston culture and LA culture. .
Wow, there is a really big difference socially--in Boston Deaf culture, everyone mixes together as if we were from the same family. .
People make sure to keep in touch. Even if you dislike someone, we say "ah, forget it" and welcome him because we would feel bad otherwise. .
But in the LA area or north, well really mostly in LA area, there are many smaller cliques. .
You have to make a name for yourself before you join the "elite" clubs. .
Still, I hope that Boston could give LA a good example of cohesiveness .
No matter who we are, it is important to have diversity in the group. .
It's the same thing with Siberian tigers--their stripes vary.  It's the same idea here in Boston. .
But in the LA area, they didn't see that way. .
They say, "If you are my kind, come with me; If you're not--get outta here."  They pick and choose. .
I don't buy it.  Oh, and LA is very fancy and high-class. .
Like for an example, when I went to Beverly Hills... .
In one store, I was looking at this really nice silk shirt. .
I decided to check the price.  I see the price tag: 350 dollars.  Really, 350 dollars for a shirt?! .
I would say the most expensive shirt here in Boston is up to maybe 100, 150 dollars.  I wouldn't know--I don't buy expensive shirts, but hey. .
Still, wow, it is very expensive in LA. .
Same idea for food shopping: in LA, a loaf of bread costs 3 or 4 bucks while here in Boston it's only $1.50 to two dollars and it is even a bigger loaf than in LA. .
Really, I'm not just talking about just economic differences, but rather cultural differences as well. .
Bostonians seem more friendly in general. .
For example: here, when I'm driving, and two cars come up to the same intersection, .
I would wave the other person on, he would say "Thanks!" and wave back. .
But in LA, would they do that? No--they don't care and just drive right through. .
A few times while I was in LA, I waved people on.  I thought they would say thanks back, but the other drivers just ignored me and zipped across.  I said, "Oh, you're welcome, too. Oh well," and drove on. .
Its same kind of situation in food markets, restaurants, banks, and many different places. .
Here (in Boston), they have good service, well not 100 percent of time but you tend to get good service---they make sure you're comfortable. .
In LA, the service is awful; some people can't speak English. .
I would write something down but they still wouldn't understand me.  That's how bad the service is in LA! .
People were not very outgoing, friendly, welcoming in the community. .
I think its probably because LA is big so they didnt really care about community as much as Bostonians do. .
Who hates John? .
When you finish reading the magazine, you will read a book. .
Now, let's watch some dramas that are somewhat different. .
They involve many characters, ... .
... people, and action. .
The deaf community has a wide variety of performance genres, ... .
...everything from short skits to full length plays. .
One of these pieces, called "Seeing Place", ... .
...written by Rico Peterson,... .
...involves both Deaf and hearing characters. .
Freda Norman, ... .
... a long-time actress, has been in numerous dramatic works. .
So, she will perform an excerpt from that (Rico's) play. .
She'll select one section... .
...that's actually a stage presentation which is... .
...a monologue. .
How many books will John buy? .
Is that his father's car? .
Some student has the videotape. .
What are you doing tomorrow? .
Has someone seen Joan? .
Who arrived? .
The cars Jon gave the teacher, how many cars was it? .
As a boy, John used to play pinball all day. .
Sue is buying that blue car. .
How many books will John buy? .
John will have seen Mary. .
The teacher gives the boy a book repeatedly. .
Why should father buy that book? .
I am sure you noticed this bandage on my hand and wonder what happened. .
Yesterday, I worked with my friend. .
Tony and I grew up best friends. .
We were working, doing landscaping. .
We were cutting wood using a cutting tool that had a metal edge. .
The metal corner was really sharp! It had a big log on it. .
There was many different sizes. .
My boss is pretty strict. .
He told us we must finish everything before sunset. .
I worked at a quick pace. .
There was one big log that I picked up but then I started to drop it. .
I tried to catch it. .
I got the log but the metal corner hit my hand. .
When the metal corner sliced my hand, really, wow! .
It looked like my fingers had been cut off! .
It was not first time someone cut his finger with that same machine. .
Anyway, I tapped Tony and told him the bad news. .
I showed him my hand--it was bleeding profusely. .
Tony said that I should go to the hospital and I asked, "are you sure?" .
I thought maybe I could just bandage it and put pressure on it so it wouldn't bleed anymore. .
I was holding my hand but it still bled through my shirt.  Can you imagine that? .
So I decided go to the hospital. .
I told my boss that I had to go to the hospital because I needed stitches. .
I thought to myself "fine" and went off to the hospital. .
A thought struck me; I pulled out my wallet and opened it... .
...I realized I didn't have my insurance information with me. .
So we pulled over to a pay phone and Tony called the boss .
The boss said his company would cover the costs for stitches on my finger and everything. .
My boss said, "Yes, go ahead and use my name." I was relieved. .
If he didn't pay for it then I don't know what I would have done! .
They maybe would have to send the bill to my parents. My parents wouldn't be very happy. .
I went to the hospital, but you know how hospitals are, they tend to keep you waiting forever! .
We sat down with them to give information about the insurance, my birth date, my social security number, etc. .
I sat down and waited for a long time.  Finally, I went in. .
I was in the fast express care of the emergency area of the hospital. .
...you know, they have different buildings for different wards.  I went in and waited some more. .
My hand kept bleeding and I was still waiting. .
A doctor came in, he was new and had just joined the staff. .
I was a bit nervous--I trust young doctors, but would prefer an older one;  it doesn't matter though, it was fine. .
He looked at my finger and said he would like to call for a second opinion. .
I thought "ugh" and ended up waiting again. .
I arrived there at two o'clock and it was already like 4:30 or 5 o'clock... .
I still hadn't gotten my stitches. .
I hoped my finger wouldn't become dry (the blood) or whatever. So I kept waiting. .
